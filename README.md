# inlineStyles

## Radium
* Merging styles using {[ ]}, brackets is provided by Radium, so make sure it is imported and initialized.
* Only supports basic event handler, others need to be implemented by JS ie css hover:disabled

## Radium with ReactJS
Troubleshooting: If css is not applied, check if @Radium or Radium hoc has been imported and initialized in your component.
